# Web-Design-Learning
I learned HTML and CSS for the first time at FreeCodeCamp. I finished the certificate program in April 2022. Around December 2023, I revisited my certificate program to discover that the course materials had been updated. Now, the old program is called "Legacy Responsive Web Design Challenges" and the new program is called "Responsive Web Design Certification". I managed to complete the new program again to update my knowledge.
This repository is a reflection of my learning journey as it contains a few front-end pages I created by applying my knowledge from both versions and some other guided pages.
