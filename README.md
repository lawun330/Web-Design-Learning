# Web-Design-Learning

This repository reflects my learning journey regarding web designs. I learned HTML and CSS at FreeCodeCamp and PHP at Udemy. It contains some guided pages and a few front-end pages I created based on my understanding.

# Changes with Edits

- 2024 june edit: I finished the FCC certificate program in April 2022. Around December 2023, I revisited my program to discover that the course materials had been updated. Now, the old program is called [Legacy Responsive Web Design Challenges](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/) and the new program is called [Responsive Web Design Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/). I managed to complete the new program to update my knowledge.

- 2024 october edit: I added <code>Franklin's Restaurant</code> website written in PHP. It is a guided project from Brad Hussey in his free PHP course on Udemy. The course is called [Practical PHP: Master the Basics and Code Dynamic Websites](https://www.udemy.com/course/code-dynamic-websites/). The <code>styles.css</code> file is crafted by Brad Hussey himself. The PHP plugin [<code>store-hours.php</code>](https://github.com/coryetzkorn/php-store-hours/tree/a67d4a5a40241a7d1ca441e4d912319d43be3cd1) is downloaded from the old version of the current [<code>PHP-store-hours</code> repository](https://github.com/coryetzkorn/php-store-hours). To see the website, you will need MAMP to host Apache server.
